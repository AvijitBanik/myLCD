1. First include the library in your sketch.
example:-	#include<LCD.h>

2. Create a lcd object which will have the i2c address as the parameter.
example:-	lcd display(0x20); //display is the object and 0x20 is the i2c address in hexadecimal.

3. Now you can access the library functions.

initiate(col, row);// initialize the the device with the required settings.
endDisplay(); // disconnect the device and terminates the wire functionalities.
